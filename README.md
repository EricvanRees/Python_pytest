## What is pytest?
* A testing framework for Python
* Auto-discovery of tests (= picking up tests by the way we name them such as filename)
* Rich assertion introspection (= when the test fails, a clean report is provided that says why)easy (= run a test multiple times with different args easily)

## Why use Pytest?
* Has a very simplified syntax
* Has a rich assertion introspection
* Has a powerful fixture system
* Compatibility (easily migrate to other testing frameworks)
* Extensibility (has a rich plugin architecture)
